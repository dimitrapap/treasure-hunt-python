# treasure-hunt-python
This is a skript that was written in me early years in University
This is a simple treasure hunt game in python.

The player starts in a random position and has to find a treasure that is in a random position as well.

This script was made under my Undergraduate program at University of Piraeus (Greece) - Department of Informatics
